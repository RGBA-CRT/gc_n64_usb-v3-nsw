    port adapters.
  - Add a feature to swap the main analog stick and the D-Pad
  - Save memory in usb.c (no user visible effects)
  - Correct bootloader entry address (*maybe* less chances of failing)

  - Internal changes to workaround a presumed Windows bug (Joystick ID
  confusion where the second controller stops working or gives an
  error in the Game controller test dialog)
  - Implement a feature to let the adapter manager query the feature
  set of the current firmware.
